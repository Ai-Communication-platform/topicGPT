[guideline]
Step 1: Determine the emotions mentioned in the document.

Emotion labels should be as general as possible. It should not be document specific.
The emotion must be a single emotion. It should not be a combination of several emotions.
New emotions should have a level number, a simple generic label, and an emotion description.
The sentiment must be broad enough to accommodate future detailed topics.
Step 2: Do one of the following:

If there are already duplicate or related sentiments in the hierarchy, we print those sentiments and stop there.
If the document has no sentiment, it returns "None".
Otherwise, add your emotion as the top emotion. It stops here and prints out the added emotion. Don't add any extra levels.
The modified prompt identifies emotions based on the content of the document and labels them in a generalized form. Additionally, if the emotion already exists in the emotion hierarchy, the emotion is returned to avoid duplication, and if it is a new emotion, it is added as the top emotion.
